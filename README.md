## Abstract
This documentation is a PORT of the ORIGINAL MiniLibX docs. It describes
the Python package that provides access to the MiniLibX graphics
library. It allows creating windows, drawing pixels, handling images,
and capturing keyboard and mouse input through a thin wrapper over the
original C API, keeping function names and behavior as close as possible
to the native MiniLibX library.

## Introduction

The MiniLibX Python Wrapper allows you to create graphical software
easily without any knowledge of X-Window/Wayland/Vulkan on Unix/Linux,
or AppKit on macOS. It provides:

- Window creation and management
- Pixel-level drawing
- Image manipulation for faster rendering
- Keyboard and mouse input handling
- PNG and XPM image loading

### How a graphics server works

This library interacts with the underlying graphics system of your
operating system. Before diving into usage, it’s helpful to understand
how graphics servers manage windows and handle user input.

#### Historical X-Window concept

X-Window is a network-oriented graphical system for Unix. It is based on
two main parts:

- On one side, your software wants to draw something on the screen and
  or get keyboard & mouse entries.

- On the other side, the X-Server manages the screen, keyboard and mouse
  (It is often referred to as a "display").

A network connection must be established between these two entities to
send drawing orders (from the software to the X-Server), and
keyboard/mouse events (from the X-Server to the software).

Nowadays, most of the time, both run on the same computer.

#### Modern graphical approach

Modern computers come with a powerful GPU that is directly accessed by
applications. Along GPU libraries like Vulkan or OpenGL, the Wayland
protocol ensure communication with the compositor program that manages
the various windows on screen and the user input events. For your own
application:

- The Vulkan or OpenGL library allow you to directly draw any content
  into your window.
- The Wayland compositor handles the place of your window on screen and
  send you back the keyboard and mouse inputs from the user.

Unfortunately, this gain of graphical power through GPU access removes
the networking aspects that exist with X-Window. It is not possible for
a program to access a remote GPU and show its window on a remote
display. But current software architectures are more likely based on a
local display application that gets data in JSON through a web API.

## Getting started

## Clone the source code

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/42school/mlx_CLXV.git
```

### Requirements

#### Arch Linux

``` bash
sudo pacman -S libxcb xcb-util-keysyms zlib libbsd vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-tools shaderc
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu

``` bash
sudo apt install libxcb libxcb-keysyms libvulkan libz libbsd glslc
```

### Installation

First compile MiniLibX.

``` bash
make install
```

Create a virtual environment with your preferred manager and open it:

- For bash/zsh:

``` bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- For fish:

``` bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

And install the package:

``` bash
pip install mlx_CLXV-2.2-py3-none-any.whl
```

#### Fallback

As a fallback, you can use the packages distributed in the intranet
**mlx-2.2-py3-ubuntu-any.whl** and **mlx-2.2-py3-fedora-any.whl**
(accessed on January 29, 2026).

In case you get an error when installing the distributed packages, try
changing the name to **mlx-2.2-py3-none-any.whl**.

### Example of use

This small Python script displays a small black window with text. It
will also print the screen dimensions to stdout and listen for user
clicks.

We will explain the functions used in this example later.

``` python
from mlx import Mlx

def mymouse(button, x, y, mystuff):
    print(f"Got mouse event! button {button} at {x},{y}.")

def mykey(keynum, mystuff):
    print(f"Got key {keynum}, and got my stuff back:")
    print(mystuff)
    if keynum == 32:
        m.mlx_mouse_hook(win_ptr, None, None)

m = Mlx()
mlx_ptr = m.mlx_init()
win_ptr = m.mlx_new_window(mlx_ptr, 200, 200, "test")
m.mlx_clear_window(mlx_ptr, win_ptr)
m.mlx_string_put(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, 20, 20, 255, "Hello PyMlx!")
(ret, w, h) = m.mlx_get_screen_size(mlx_ptr)
print(f"Got screen size: {w} x {h} .")

stuff = [1, 2]
m.mlx_mouse_hook(win_ptr, mymouse, None)
m.mlx_key_hook(win_ptr, mykey, stuff)

m.mlx_loop(mlx_ptr)
```

## Behind the Scenes

When an instance of the Mlx class is created, the first thing it does is
construct the path to the C library called libmlx.so.

``` python
def __init__(self):
  module_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
  self.so_file = os.path.join(module_dir, "libmlx.so")
  #...
```

- \_\_file\_\_ is a special Python variable that contains the path to
  the file where this code is executed.

- os.path.dirname extracts the path from **file** and uses os.path.join
  to create the path to the library.

It then declares the mlx_func variable, which acts as a bridge between
Python and C. Using the CDLL function from Python’s ctypes module, it
loads the library and calls the original functions.

``` python
def __init__(self):
  # ...
  self.mlx_func = CDLL(self.so_file)
  # ...
```

For each C function available in the Python wrapper, there is a
declaration within the Mlx class:

``` python
def mlx_init(self):
  self.mlx_func.mlx_init.restype = c_void_p
  return self.mlx_func.mlx_init()
```

You can see how it calls mlx_func.mlx_init(). This mlx_init() is already
the original C function. It is necessary to specify the data type
returned by the function with mlx_init.restype, which in this case is
c_void_p (equivalent to void \*).

All of this is passed to CDLL, which, using the previously loaded
library, will execute the function and return whatever the function
returns.

## Initialization and cleanup: mlx_init(), mlx_release()

### Synopsis

``` python
from mlx import Mlx

def mlx_init() -> int: # void *

def mlx_release() -> int: # void *
```

### Description

First of all, you need to initialize the connection between your
software and the graphic and user sub-systems. Once this completed,
you’ll be able to use other MiniLibX functions to send and receive the
messages from the display, like “I want to draw a yellow pixel in this
window” or “did the user hit a key?”.

The mlx_init function will create this connection. No parameters are
needed, ant it will return a void \* identifier, used for further calls
to the library routines. The mlx_release function can be used at the end
of the program to disconnect from the graphic system and release
resources.

If **mlx_init()** fails to set up the connection to the display, it will
return None.

### Return values

If **mlx_init()** set up the connection to the display correctly, it
will return an **int as a pointer**; otherwise, it returns **None**.

## Managing windows: mlx_new_window(), mlx_clear_window, mlx_destroy_window

### Synopsis

``` python
    def mlx_new_window(mlx_ptr: int, width: int, height: int, title: str ) -> int: # void *

    def mlx_clear_window(mlx_ptr: int, win_ptr: int) -> int:

    def mlx_destroy_window(mlx_ptr: int, win_ptr: int ) -> int:
```

### Description

The **mlx_new_window** () function creates a new window on the screen,
using the *width* and *height* parameters to determine its size, and
*title* as the text that should be displayed in the window's title bar.

The *mlx_ptr* parameter is the connection identifier returned by
**mlx_init** () (see the **mlx** man page). **mlx_new_window** ()
returns a *void \** window identifier that can be used by other MiniLibX
calls.

Note that the MiniLibX can handle an arbitrary number of separate
windows.

**mlx_clear_window** () and **mlx_destroy_window** () respectively clear
(in black) and destroy the given window. They both have the same
parameters: *mlx_ptr* is the screen connection identifier, and *win_ptr*
is a window identifier.

### Return values

If **mlx_new_window()** fails to create a new window (whatever the
reason), it will return NULL, otherwise a non-null pointer is returned
as a window identifier.

**mlx_clear_window** and **mlx_destroy_window** return nothing.

## Drawing inside windows: mlx_pixel_put(), mlx_string_put()

### Synopsis

``` python
    def mlx_pixel_put(mlx_ptr: int, win_ptr: int, x: int, y: int, color: int) -> int:

    def mlx_string_put(mlx_ptr: int, win_ptr: int, x: int, y: int, color: int, string: str) -> int:
```

### Description

The **mlx_pixel_put** () function draws a defined pixel in the window
*win_ptr* using the ( *x* , *y* ) coordinates, and the specified
*color*.

The origin (0,0) is the upper left corner of the window, the x and y
axis respectively pointing right and down. The connection identifier,
*mlx_ptr* , is needed (see the **mlx** man page).

Parameters for **mlx_string_put** () have the same meaning. Instead of a
simple pixel, the specified *string* will be displayed at ( *x* , *y* ).

Both functions will discard any display outside the window. This makes
**mlx_pixel_put** slow. Consider using images instead.

### Color management

The *color* parameter has an unsigned integer type. The displayed colour
needs to be encoded in this integer, following a defined scheme. All
displayable colours can be split in 3 basic colours: red, green and
blue. Three associated values, in the 0-255 range, represent how much of
each colour is mixed up to create the original colour. The fourth byte
represent transparency, where 0 is fully transparent and 255 opaque.

Theses four values must be set inside the unsigned integer to display
the right colour. The bytes of this integer are filled as shown in the
picture below:

            | B | G | R | A |   colour integer
            +---+---+---+---+

While filling the integer, make sure you avoid endian problems.

Example: the "blue" byte will be the least significant byte inside the
integer on a little endian machine.

## Manipulating images: mlx_new_image(), mlx_get_data_addr(), mlx_put_image_to_window(), mlx_xpm_file_to_image(), mlx_png_file_to_image(), mlx_destroy_image()

### Synopsis

``` python
    def mlx_new_image(mlx_ptr: int, width: int, height: int) -> int: # void *

    def mlx_get_data_addr(img_ptr: int, bits_per_pixel: int, size_line: int, format: int) -> tuple[memoryview, int, int, int]:

    def mlx_put_image_to_window(mlx_ptr: int, win_ptr: int, img_ptr: int, x: int, y: int) -> int:

    def mlx_xpm_file_to_image(mlx_ptr: int, filename: str) -> int: # void *

    def mlx_png_file_to_image(mlx_ptr: int, filename: str) -> int: # void *

    def mlx_destroy_image(mlx_ptr: int, img_ptr: int) -> int:
```

### Description

**mlx_new_image** () creates a new image in memory. It returns an *int
pointer* needed to manipulate this image later. It only needs the size
of the image to be created, using the *width* and *height* parameters,
and the *mlx_ptr* connection identifier.

The user can draw inside the image (see below), and can dump the image
inside a specified window at any time to display it on the screen. This
is done using **mlx_put_image_to_window** (). Three identifiers are
needed here, for the connection to the display, the window to use, and
the image (respectively *mlx_ptr* , *win_ptr* and *img_ptr* ). The (
*x*, *y* ) coordinates define where the image should be placed in the
window.

**mlx_get_data_addr** () returns information about the created image,
allowing a user to modify it later. The *img_ptr* parameter specifies
the image to use. The three next parameters should be the addresses of
three different valid unsigned integers. *bits_per_pixel* will be filled
with the number of bits needed to represent a pixel colour (also called
the depth of the image). *size_line* is the number of bytes used to
store one line of the image in memory. This information is needed to
move from one line to another in the image. *format* tells you how each
pixel colour in the image is structured.

Currently only 2 values aredefined:

0 means format B8G8R8A8

1 means format A8R8G8B8

**mlx_get_data_addr** returns an *int pointer* to the address address
that represents the beginning of the memory area where the image is
stored. From this address, the first *bits_per_pixel* bits represent the
colour of the first pixel in the first line of the image. The second
group of *bits_per_pixel* bits represent the second pixel of the first
line, and so on. Add *size_line* to the address to get the beginning of
the second line. You can reach any pixels of the image that way.

**mlx_destroy_image** destroys the given image ( *img_ptr* ).

### Storing colours inside images

Depending on the graphic system, the number of bits used to store a
pixel colour used to be different from one hardware to another. Today,
the way the user usually represents a colour, in the ARGB mode, almost
always matches the hardware capabilities on modern computers.

Keep in mind that packing the 4-byte ARGB into an unsigned int depends
on the local computer’s endian. Adjust your code accordingly.

### XPM and PNG images

The **mlx_xpm_file_to_image** () and **mlx_png_file_to_image** ()
functions will create a new image the same way. They will fill it using
the specified *xpm_data* or *filename* , depending on which function is
used. Note that MiniLibX does not use the standard Xpm and png libraries
to deal with xpm and png images.

You may not be able to read all types of xpm and png images. It however
handles transparency.

**mlx_xpm_to_image()** is not implemented in the Python wrapper as it is
considered not useful in this context.

### Return values

The three functions that create images, **mlx_new_image()**,
**mlx_xpm_file_to_image()** and **mlx_png_file_to_image()** , will
return NULL if an error occurs.

Otherwise they return a non-null pointer as an image identifier.

## Handle events: mlx_loop(), mlx_key_hook(), mlx_mouse_hook(), mlx_expose_hook(), mlx_loop_hook(), mlx_loop_hook()

### Synopsis

``` python
    def mlx_loop(mlx_ptr: int) -> int:

    def mlx_key_hook(win_ptr: int, callback: Callable[Any], param: Any) -> int:

    def mlx_mouse_hook(win_ptr: int, callback: Callable[Any], param: Any) -> int:

    def mlx_expose_hook(win_ptr: int, callback: Callable[Any], param: Any) -> int:

    def mlx_loop_hook(mlx_ptr: int, callback: Callable[Any], param: Any) -> int:

    def mlx_loop_exit(mlx_ptr: int) -> None:
```

### Events

The graphical system is bi-directional. On one hand, the program sends
orders to the screen to display pixels, images, and so on. On the other
hand, it can get information from the keyboard and mouse associated to
the screen. To do so, the program receives “events” from the keyboard or
the mouse.

### Description

To receive events, you must use **mlx_loop** (). This function never
returns, unless **mlx_loop_exit** is called. It is an infinite loop that
waits for an event, and then calls a user-defined function associated
with this event. A single parameter is needed, the connection identifier
*mlx_ptr*.

You can assign different functions to the three following events: - A
key is released - The mouse button is pressed - A part of the window
should be re-drawn (this is called an “expose” event, and it is your
program’s job to handle it in the Unix/Linux X11 environment, but at the
opposite it never happens on Unix/Linux Wayland-Vulkan nor on MacOS).

Each window can define a different function for the same event.

The three functions **mlx_key_hook** (), **mlx_mouse_hook** () and
**mlx_expose_hook** () work exactly the same way. *callback* is a
reference to the function that is invoked when an event occurs. This
assignment is specific to the window defined by the *win_ptr*
identifier. The *param* address will be passed back to your function
every time it is called, and should be used to store the parameters it
might need.

The syntax for the **mlx_loop_hook** () function is similar to the
previous ones, but the given function will be called when no event
occurs, and is not bound to a specific window.

When it catches an event, the MiniLibX calls the corresponding function
with fixed parameters:

      expose_hook(void *param);
      key_hook(unsigned int keycode, void *param);
      mouse_hook(unsigned int button, unsigned int x, unsigned int y, void *param);
      loop_hook(void *param);

These function names are arbitrary. They here are used to distinguish
parameters according to the event. These functions are NOT part of the
MiniLibX.

*param* is the address specified in the mlx\_\*\_hook calls. This
address is never used nor modified by the MiniLibX. On key and mouse
events, additional information is passed: *keycode* tells you which key
is pressed (just try to find out :) ), ( *x* , *y* ) are the coordinates
of the mouse click in the window, and *button* tells you which mouse
button was pressed.

### Going further with events

The MiniLibX provides a much generic access to other available events.
The *mlx.h* include define **mlx_hook()** in the same manner
mlx\_\*\_hook functions work. The event and mask values will be taken
from the historical X11 include file "X.h". Some Wayland and MacOS
events are mapped to these values when it makes sense, and the mask may
not be used in some configurations.

See source code of the MiniLibX to find out how it will call your own
function for a specific event.

## Extra functions

### Synopsis

``` python
    def mlx_mouse_hide(mlx_ptr: int) -> int:

    def mlx_mouse_show(mlx_ptr: int) -> int:

    def mlx_mouse_move(mlx_ptr: int, x: int, y: int) -> int:

    def mlx_mouse_get_pos(win_ptr: int) -> tuple(int, int, int):

    def mlx_do_key_autorepeatoff(mlx_ptr: int) -> int:

    def mlx_do_key_autorepeaton(mlx_ptr: int) -> int:

    def mlx_get_screen_size(mlx_ptr: int) -> tuple(int, int, int):

    def mlx_do_sync(mlx_ptr: int) -> int:

    def mlx_sync(mlx_ptr: int, cmd: int, img_or_win_ptr: int) -> int:
```

### Mouse extra functions

It is possible to show / hide the mouse, and get its current position
without user click or force its position inside a window.

### Keyboard extra functions

The auto-repeat mode of the keyboard can be controlled. By default,
auto-repeat is on: multiple “key pressed” events are generated every
second until the key is released.

### Screen extra function

It is possible to retrieve the size of the current screen, even before
the first window is created.

### Flush and sync functions

The **mlx_do_sync** function will flush the pending commands to the
graphic subsystems, ensuring nothing is cached on your software’s side.
On return, there is no guarantee that your commands have been processed.

With **mlx_sync** you have more detailed control over the
synchronisation mechanisms. Three different commands are available:
SYNC_IMAGE_WRITABLE = 1 SYNC_WIN_FLUSH = 2 SYNC_WIN_COMPLETED = 3 The
third parameter *param* can be either the image identifier or the window
identifier.
